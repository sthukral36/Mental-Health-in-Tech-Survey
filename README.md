## Corporate Mental Health Analysis

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict mental health issues among employees in a corporate environment using machine learning techniques.
By leveraging survey data, the project seeks to identify key factors influencing mental health and develop a predictive model to assist organizations in proactive mental health management.
Mental health issues in the workplace are increasingly becoming a concern for organizations. Early identification and proactive management can significantly improve employee well-being and productivity.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Model training and evaluation
Hyperparameter tuning
Visualization of results
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, which includes anonymized responses to a mental health survey conducted among corporate employees. The dataset contains information on:

- Demographic details (age, gender, etc.)
- Work-related factors (position, work hours, etc.)
- Mental health history and current status
- Treatment and support availability
- Job locations like working Remote /Hybrid.
-


 
Data Preprocessing
Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset like removing outliers filled missing values , feature selection,
label encoding , made some meaningful visualization.

 
Model Training and Evaluation
Run the model training script to train and evaluate the machine learning models using hyper parameter tunning and tried different models in order to find the best fit model for our data.

 
Results
This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting mental health issues in the workplace, offering organizations valuable insights to improve employee well-being.
 The use of machine learning techniques ensures accurate predictions and effective mental health management.
